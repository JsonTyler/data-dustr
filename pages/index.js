          <div className="about-content">
            <p>
              I started Datadustr while digging through church records and family documents to apply for my own dual citizenship. The process was confusing, scattered, and full of dead ends ‚Äî and I realized others were stuck in the same mess.
            </p>
            <p>
              Datadustr exists to bring structure to family history. Whether you're applying for citizenship, exploring your roots, or just trying to make sense of what you inherited, we help you find the records, understand what they mean, and keep it all organized.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don't offer generic tree builders or vague templates. We do the real work ‚Äî searching archives, translating old documents, building clean digital trees, and preparing your paperwork so you're ready for whatever comes next.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some clients come to us with nothing but a name and a country. Others have folders of scanned documents they‚Äôve never fully processed. No matter where you're starting from, we make sense of the mess, identify what matters, and structure it clearly ‚Äî so your family history isn't just collected, it's understood.
            </p>
            <p>
              At its core, Datadustr is about dusting off the forgotten, the misfiled, and the nearly-lost ‚Äî and turning it into something real. Something you can share. Something that gives you answers.
